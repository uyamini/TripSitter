# TripSitter

I made this app for my friend who moved to London to do her Master's. 
When I tried suggesting places for her to visit every now and then, it would always get lost amongst our texts and she would forget. 
So I wanted to build a platform where I can put those suggestions all in one place.
She can take a look at it whenever she's bored, check which place is closest for her to visit depending on where she is at the time, read a brief description about it and easily navigate to it.
